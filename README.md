## Customer Support Mailing Automation
A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook project for customer support automation using the CrewAI Python framework. This notebook demonstrates how to build, deploy, and quality-assure multi-agent AI workflows to automate and enhance customer support interactions, including personalized email outreach and support ticket handling.
This project demonstrates how to build an **AI-powered Customer Support Automation system** using [CrewAI](https://pypi.org/project/crewai/), `crewai_tools`, and `langchain_community`.  
It simulates a customer support workflow where multiple AI agents collaborate to resolve customer queries, ensure quality assurance, and interact with external tools such as CRMs, bug trackers, and feature request databases.

### Features
- Role-play Agents: Senior Support Representative and Support Quality Assurance Specialist modeled as CrewAI Agents, each with unique goals, behaviors, and memory.
- Automated Support Handling: Respond to inbound customer inquiries with context-aware, friendly, and comprehensive answers using LLMs.
- Quality Assurance: Integrate a QA agent to review support responses for accuracy, tone, completeness, and professionalism.
- Custom Tools: Example implementations to load customer data, scrape documentation, run sentiment analysis, connect to CRMs, and more.
- Personalized Outreach: Build and profile customer leads, then generate tailored outreach emails based on their profile and recent milestones.
- Extensible Task Framework: Easily add new agents or tasks for other automation and workflow needs (e.g., bug reports, feature requests).

- **Multi-Agent Support Flow**  
  - A **Senior Support Representative Agent** answers customer queries.  
  - A **Support QA Agent** reviews responses for accuracy and friendliness.  
  - Agents can **delegate tasks** to each other for better cooperation.




## Features

- **Role-Playing & Backstories**  
  Agents are given unique roles, goals, and backstories to improve realism and alignment with business objectives.

- **Custom Tools Integration**  
  Examples of tools that can be connected:  
  - Customer data lookups  
  - Previous conversation history  
  - CRM integration  
  - Bug reports & feature requests  
  - Ticketing system queries  

- **CrewAI Workflow**  
  Uses **CrewAI** to orchestrate tasks and interactions between agents.

##  Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-support-automation.git
cd customer-support-automation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install dependencies directly (from inside the notebook):

```bash
pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
```

##  Setup

Before running the notebook, set up your **API keys**:

```python
import os
from google.colab import userdata

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("OPENAI_API_KEY_1")
os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # or another model
```

##  Usage

1. Open the notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CustomerSupportAutomation.ipynb
   ```

2. Define your **Support Agent** and **QA Agent** with roles, goals, and backstories.

3. Run tasks using CrewAI orchestration:  
   ```python
   support_task = Task(
       description="Resolve customer billing issue politely",
       agent=support_agent,
   )

   crew = Crew(agents=[support_agent, qa_agent], tasks=[support_task])
   result = crew.kickoff()
   print(result)
   ```

4. Extend the workflow by connecting to external tools (CRM, bug tracker, etc.).
